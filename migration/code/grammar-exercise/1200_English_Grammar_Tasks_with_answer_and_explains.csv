How ______ photos do you need?,4,much,lots of,little,many,"We use the quantifiers ‘much’, ‘many’, ‘lots of’, ‘a lot’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We use ‘much’ with singular uncountable nouns and ‘many’ with plural nouns. ‘Lots’ and ‘a lot’ are similar in meaning to ‘much’ and ‘many’, but we use ‘lots’ and ‘a lot’ in informal styles to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. ‘Lots’ is even more informal than ‘a lot’. The quantifier ‘little’ has a negative meaning and we use it to mean ‘not as much as may be expected or wished for’. We use ‘little’ with singular uncountable nouns.At the beginning of the test sentence ‘How ______ photos do you need?’ there is a word ‘How’ and then a noun ‘photos’ in the plural form. The quantifier ‘lots of’ cannot be used after the question word ‘how’.Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4 – ‘many’.","some,any, a lot of , many , much ,etc..",1, 138 ,1200 Grammer Tests

The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma. The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition.But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen.In the test sentence (ANSWER 4) ‘If she won the contest, she would be very happy.’ it is meant that she would like to win the contest or somebody imagines how she would feel if she won. We are still thinking about the future, but it is imaginary. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.",conditionals,1, 139 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. When we report yes/no questions we use the conjunctions ‘if’ or ‘whether’ after the reporting clause: ask(-s/- ed) + if/whether. We make the same changes in tense, pronouns and time and place words as for reported statements. If the reporting clause is in the Simple Past, we usually need to change the tenses: Monica asked: “Does George work inMexico?” → Monica asked if/whether George worked in Mexico.In the test sentence the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Paul asked me…’, therefore, we need to change ‘will’into ‘would’ and ‘tomorrow’ into ‘the next day’ or ‘the following day”, remembering about the statement word order.

We usually put adverbials of frequency (1) in front of the main verb (between the subject and the main verb), or (2) after the modal verb or first auxiliary verb, or (3) after be as a main verb:I often see her there. But we can also use it (4) in front position that is the least common position, and sounds more formal: Often Jane would go for a swim. And we can put ‘often’ (5) in end position: Do you goon business trip often? If the sentence has more than one verb in it (e.g. auxiliary verb) we usually put the adverb after the first part of the verb: Diana doesn't usually swim on Sundays.

In the test sentence the main topic is ‘The Beatles’. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. The test sentence ‘The Beatles _____________ (to know) all over the world.’ can be transformed to its active voice equivalent ‘All over the world, people know the Beatles.’ (the present simple),therefore, we choose ANSWER 2 – ‘are known’.",passive voice,1, 146 ,1200 Grammer Tests

You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it. In the test sentence we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs ‘to sample clothing to see if it fits’.

And we understand that there is nobody in the classroom. But the next test sentence, where we should fill the gap, has no negative particle ‘not’: ‘I can see ______ here.’ Therefore,we choose ANSWER 4 – to use ‘nobody’ to refer to an absence of people. We do not use another negative in a clause with ‘nobody’: Nobody came.; Nothing happened.If the second sentence had the negative particle ‘not’: I cannot see ______ here.’, we would choose ANSWER 2 (anybody).

The most common negative prefixes in English are in-, un-, non-, de-, dis-, a-, anti-, im-, il-, and ir-.The adjective ‘abnormal’ is formed by adding the negative prefix ab- to the adjective ‘normal’ and means ‘different from what is normal or usual, in a way which is strange or dangerous’ (an abnormal amount of snow; abnormal behavior). The origin of this adjective is French: the alteration of French anormal that comes from Medieval Latin anormalis that comes in its turn from Latin a- + Late Latin normalis (normal).By this formation we have an antonym pair: normal – abnormal.

They are especially important for indicating the time(when), manner (the way something happens or is done), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something. In the test sentence we need to choose a degree adverb. Degree adverbs express degrees of qualities, properties, states, conditions and relations. In the test sentence the adverb expresses the degree of state: to what extent Sarah is beautiful.Adverbs of degree usually end in -ly (completely, fairly). Among the test variants, only one ends in -ly:ANSWER 3.

"I met Alice, _____ asked me to tell you about the accident.",2,which,who,whom,whose,"Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause) and help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: He is the man who I was talking about. We introduce a relative clause with a relative pronoun (who, whom, whose, which or that).In the test sentence ‘I met Alice, _____ asked me to tell you about the accident.’ We need to choose a relative pronoun that is used at the beginning of a relative clause to show which person we are talking about,because in the relative clause we are told more about Alice (a person). Therefore, among all the given test answers we need to choose the relative pronouns ‘who’ or ‘whom’ that are used for people. But for the test sentence we need to choose a relative pronoun that is the subject of the relative clause (I met Alice, _____asked …). In this case, we are to choose only the relative pronoun ‘who’ (ANSWER 2), because the relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday? Here, ‘we’ is the subject.We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.

Many animals are ____ danger.,4,by,at,on,in,"In the test sentence ‘Many animals are ____ danger.’ the prepositional phrase to refresh is ‘in danger’.Prepositional phrases consist of a preposition and the words which follow it (a complement). The complement is most commonly a noun phrase or pronoun, an adverb phrase, a verb in the -ing form or, a prepositional phrase or a wh-clause. In the test sentence the compliment is the noun ‘danger’ that means ‘the possibility of suffering harm or injury’ (her life was in danger). To specify, ‘in danger’, here, is the subject complement - a word, phrase, or clause that follows a copular, or linking, verb and describes the subject of a clause (here, ‘many animals’). And the prepositional phrase ‘in danger’ functions here as a nominal (The park is next to the hospital.) as it is used in conjunction with the verb form ‘to be’.Prepositional phrases provide important details about the words they modify, such as by answering the following questions: Which one? What kind? How? How much? Where? Why? When? To what extent?In some dictionaries the phrase ‘in danger’ is considered to be an idiom.",prepositions,1, 155 ,1200 Grammer Tests

The rules for making the plural of nouns depend on the spelling and pronunciation. Most nouns form their plural by adding -s: part – parts,cake – cakes. In other cases, the plural depends on how the noun ends. If the noun ends in -ch, -s, -sh, -x, -z,we add -es. The plural ending -es is pronounced /iz/. The noun ‘brush’ ends in -sh, therefore, we need to add-es. Consequently, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (brushes).",nouns,1, 157 ,1200 Grammer Tests

We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.; I like him very much.). We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.).We usually use ‘much’ and ‘many’ with questions (?) and negatives (−). We use ‘a few’ that means ‘some’with plural countable nouns: a few days, a few questions, a few friends.‘Some’ is a determiner and a pronoun (without a noun following, when this noun is understood). We use ‘some’ as a determiner before both countable and uncountable nouns to refer to indefinite quantities:some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) But we can use ‘some’ in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).The test sentence ‘We don't have _______ bread.’ is negative, therefore, we cannot choose ‘some’(ANSWER 3) here. The determiner that we need to choose for this test sentence is used before the uncountable noun ‘bread’, that is why we cannot choose the determiners ‘many’ and ‘a few’ because they are used only with countable nouns.

There are different types of conditions. Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely or even impossible.In the test sentence ‘If the weather ______ (to be) fine next Sunday, we _______ (to go) to the park.’ we are given the time-marker ‘next Sunday’, therefore, this sentence expresses an imagined future situation and shows that we believe the imagined situation is quite likely (It is possible or likely that the weather will be fine next Sunday.). When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall, should, would, can, could, may, might) + infinitive (a future result): If it’s a nice day tomorrow,we’ll go to the beach.

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present simple tense (‘I dance’) usually changes to the past simple (she/he danced) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence we should change ‘don’t like’ into ‘didn't like’. But it is not always necessary to change the tense.If something is still true now – she still works in an office – we can use the present simple in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Alex said that she doesn't like onion.’ is not given. Thus, we are to choose only ANSWER 3.",reported speech,1, 160 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Choose the sentence with the right word order,4,A federation is Australia of six states.,A federation of six states Australia is.,Australia of six states is a federation.,Australia is a federation of six states.,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a simple extended declarative sentence. The standard word order in simple extended declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE + object + adverbial modifier.We are to find the subject, predicate and object in the test sentence. The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb. The noun ‘federation’ means ‘a group of organizations, countries, regions, etc that have joined together to form a larger organization or government’. So, we cannot say that ‘a federation is Australia…’(ANSWER 1), because a federation is not only Australia. And neither ‘A federation of six states Australia’(ANSWER 2) nor ‘Australia of six states’ (ANSWER 3) can be the subject of the test sentence, because they are nonce word combinations. The predicate of the test sentence is represented by the main verb ‘is’.Therefore, only ANSWER 4 is correct: ‘Australia’ (the subject) ‘is’ (the predicate) and ‘a federation of six states’ (the subject complement – a phrase that completes the sense of the subject ‘Australia’ that follows the linking verb ‘is’). The subject complement is normally an adjective or a noun that renames or defines in some way the subject.",word order,1, 161 ,1200 Grammer Tests

We use ‘a’ when the next word starts with a consonant (a boy, a dog), or before words starting in u and eu when they sound like you (a university, a unit, a European style, a euro). We use ‘an’ when the next word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o,u) or with a mute h (an actor, an invitation, an eagle, an old school,an umbrella, an hour). We do not use an indefinite article with plural nouns (bears) and uncountable nouns (advice): I saw some bears in the Zoo.;She gave me good advice.The definite article ‘the’ before a noun shows that what is referred to is already known to the speaker,listener, writer and/or reader, refer to something which has already been mentioned: We went to the restaurant yesterday.; The sun rose at 5.34 in the morning.; I’ve read a book on the life of Angelina Jolie.In the test sentence ‘I bought some cheese, ten apples and _ bottle of wine.’ We should choose the article that stands before the countable noun ‘bottle’ (thus, we do not need ANSWER 4 ‘-’) that starts with the consonant ‘b’ (and it is not ANSWER 2 ‘an’).

That’s Rob!In the test sentence ‘Your puppy _______ (to swim)!’ the speaker draws someone’s attention to the puppy. As it is direct speech, we understand that something is in progress at the moment of speaking. Thus,we need the present continuous tense in the test sentence. For the present continuous we use am, are, is + the-ing form of the verb. When the verb ends in a vowel followed by a single consonant and if the last syllable is stressed, then the consonant is doubled.

Sarah spoke to Brad Pitt _____ .,3,themselves,itself,himself,yourself,"When the subject or the object in a sentence refer to the same person or thing we use a reflexive pronoun. Reflexive pronouns (myself, himself, ourselves etc) end in -self (singular form) or –selves (plural form). They refer back to the subject forms of personal pronouns.Reflexive pronouns can be used with nouns to mean ‘me (or you/him/her etc) and nobody else’ to emphasize a particular person/persons or animal/animals (male or female): Did you talk to the hostess herself or just to one of her assistants?; Do you want to meet George himself, or could his sister help you?;It is the party leaders themselves who make the decisions. In the sentence ‘I spoke to Angelina Jolie herself!’, the speaker emphasizes that he or she spoke to Angelina Jolie personally NOT somebody else.In the test sentence ‘Sarah spoke to Brad Pitt _____ .’ the particular man is emphasized – Brad Pitt.Sarah spoke to Brad Pitt personally NOT somebody else.

Michael passed the exam _______ .,2,easy,easily,ease,easier,"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘Michael passed the exam _______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘pass’ that here means ‘to succeed at an exam’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where),degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something. ‘Michael passed the exam (how?).’ So, in the test sentence we need to choose a manner adverb. They are usually placed either after the main verb or after the object.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave - bravely,sudden – suddenly. But sometimes there can be changes in spelling: hungry - hungrily; gentle – gently,happy – happily. Adverbs formed from adjectives ending in -y change the y to i: easy → easily, busy →busily, lucky → luckily, angry → angrily.In the test sentence we need to transform the adjective ‘easy’ that ends in -y into the adverb of manner,therefore, we change -y into -i and plus -ly → easily. Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 2.",adverbs,1, 172 ,1200 Grammer Tests
"We visited a city, _____ I have never been to.",4,whose,whom,who,which,"Relative pronouns who, whom, whose, which or that introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress,which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.We use ‘who’ and ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I told you about my aunt who lives next door.; I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. ‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. And we use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?.In the test sentence ‘We visited a city, _____ I have never been to.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for things, because in the relative clause we are told more about the object of the main clause - a city (a thing). Thus, among all the given test answers we need to choose the relative pronoun ‘which’ – ANSWER 4. By using the relative pronoun ‘which’, we avoid repeating the noun ‘city’in the relative clause.",relative clauses,1, 173 ,1200 Grammer Tests

There are over 100 prepositions in English. But there are hardly any rules as to when to use which preposition. We can learn prepositions by several ways: (1) look them up in a dictionary, (2) read a lot in English and (3) learn useful phrases with prepositions by heart.In the test sentence ‘I don't like most of popular shows _____ television.’ we need the preposition of place: where? → on television (‘being broadcast by television’).

We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ and ‘a little’ that means ‘not much, but some’ (‘small amount’)with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.; I like him very much.; a little bread, a little money, a little marmalade, a little time.

We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.In the test sentence He eats _______ sweets every day. we need to choose a quantifier for the countable noun ‘sweets’. Therefore, from the test variants we can choose ANSWER 1 (many) andANSWER 4 (any). The variant ‘He eats any sweets every day.’ means that he has a wide range of sweets to eat every day: chocolate, boiled, candies, fizzy, mallows etc. Maybe he is a taster.","some,any, a lot of , many , much ,etc..",1, 178 ,1200 Grammer Tests
If you ________ (to call) me I _________ (to help) you.,2,would call/helped,called/would help,would call/would help,called/helped,"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.The test sentence ‘If you called me I would help you.’ (ANSWER 2) describes an unlikely situation. It is meant that ‘You haven’t called me yet that is why I haven’t helped you, but I would like to’. We are still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that it could happen, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.",conditionals,1, 179 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present continuous tense(‘I am dancing’) usually changes to the past continuous (she/he was dancing) in reported speech. Therefore,in the test sentence we should change ‘’m driving’ into ‘was driving’. It is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she is still driving to work – we can use the present continuous in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Tracy said that she is driving to work now.’ is not given.We also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement(the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 4.",reported speech,1, 180 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Choose the sentence with the right word order,4,Is how far your town from here?,How far your town from here is?,How far your town is from here?,How far is your town from here?,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.The word order in ‘WH questions’ is similar to ‘Yes/No questions’, but in ‘WH-questions’ question words ‘when’, ‘what’, ‘who’, ‘whose’, ‘where’, ‘how’, ‘which’, ‘why’ are put at the beginning of the sentences: WH + DO/DOES + SUBJECT + VERB.In questions with the main verb ‘be’ we usually have to put the main verb ‘be’ before the subject: BE+ SUBJECT. In ‘WH-questions’ with ‘be’ we have the following rigid word order: WH + BE + SUBJECT.‘How’ is used to ask about quantity, size, or age: How big is the house? So, after the question word ‘how’ we can use an adjective or an adverb: how long (length – time or space), how many (quantity – with countable nouns), how much (quantity – with uncountable nouns), how old (age), how often (how frequently something happens).The question word-combination ‘How far’ asks for information about the distance between two places: How far is the university from your house?; How far is it to the supermarket?. It is also used to talk about how true something is: How far do politicians represent the views of ordinary people?. We should remember, when we make a question with a verb other than the be verb, we need to use an auxiliary verb(do/did, have/had, will, are/is, etc): How far do you usually walk?; How far will you drive?In the test sentence we have the form of main verb ‘be’ – ‘is’ (the third person, singular), therefore,according to the rule of ‘WH-questions’ with ‘be’, we need to put it after the question word-combination ‘how far’: ‘How far is…’.

Bob ___________ (to listen) to music when the door bell rang.,4,was listened,listen,listened,was listening,"The most common use of the past continuous tense is to talk about something that was happening around a particular time in the past: ‘In 2015 she was working in Paris.’ The past continuous is formed from the past tense of be (was/were) with the -ing form of the verb.The past continuous and the past simple are often used together. When this happens, the past continuous describes a longer, ‘surrounding’ action or situation and the past simple describes the action or events: It was raining hard when we left the office. Often, the ‘action’ described by the past simple tense interrupts the ‘situation’ described by the past continuous tense – when a new action happens in the middle of another action: Helen was talking to Max, when she heard Alex’s voice. The past continuous describes ‘situations’ that go on for some time – ‘raining’ and ‘talking’ but the past simple describes ‘actions’ that happen quickly – ‘left’ and ‘heard’.In the test sentence ‘Bob ___________ (to listen) to music when the door bell rang.’ we are given the context ‘…when the door bell rang.’ and we understand that the ring of the door bell interrupted some ‘surrounding’ situation: some action was happening before the ring of the door bell - a longer action in the past was interrupted. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 – ‘was listening’.",past tenses,1, 184 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Quebec ____________ (to capture) by the British in the 18th century.,1,was captured,captured,is captured,captures,"The passive voice is used when we want to focus attention on the person or thing affected by the action. The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’). We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.In the test sentence the main focus is on the name of the city - Quebec (the capital of the province ofQuebec in Canada) that is the subject of the test sentence. The ‘doer’ is placed in the prepositional phrase ‘by the British’. We use this structure ‘passive + by + doer’ when the agent/doer is important.In the test sentence the agent is important because of the historical context: the dramatic victory that ensured British supremacy in Canada.As it is stated in the test sentence that the capture of this city happened in the 18 th century, we are to choose ANSWER 1 ‘was captured’ – Past Simple passive. ‘Captured’ is the past participle of the regular verb ‘capture’.",passive voice,1, 186 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Phrasal verbs are two part verbs: a main verb + an adverb particle. Phrasal verbs often have meanings which we cannot easily guess from their individual parts. You may try to guess the meaning of the phrasal verb from the context, or look it up in a dictionary and learn it.In the test sentence we are given the definition of one of four phrasal verbs: ‘stop sleeping’. The phrasal verb ‘wake up’ has a similar meaning to ‘wake’ and means ‘stop sleeping or end someone else’s sleep’: She likes to wake up with a cup of strong coffee.; He wakes me up with a cup of strong coffee every morning.

We understand it from the given context ‘I’m sorry, but… in this situation.’ The adjective ‘sorry’means ‘feeling sadness, sympathy, or disappointment, especially because something unpleasant has happened or been done; feeling sad or distressed through sympathy with someone else’s misfortune’: I’m sorry you’re ill – I hope you get well soon.; I’m sorry to have heard that news about your husband. So, in the test sentence the speaker feels sad or distressed through sympathy with someone’s misfortune in that situation because he or she realizes that nothing can be done - he or she cannot do anything to help or save somebody. He or she is helpless – unable to do anything to help yourself or anyone else. We use ‘nothing’ to refer to an absence of things in affirmative sentences: There is nothing to eat.; I know nothing about it. Thus, we choose ANSWER 4: nothing.",pronouns,1, 190 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Adjectives which describe opinions or attitudes (e.g. lovely, amazing) usually come first, before more neutral,factual ones (e.g. red, green): A girl was wearing a lovely green dress. Not: … green lovely dress.It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives in front of a noun. But if it is so, the most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, bad, lovely, strange, nice, important,etc.), 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun: (a) food: tasty; delicious; (b) furniture, buildings: comfortable; uncomfortable; (c) people,animals: clever; intelligent; friendly.), 3. size (big, small, tall), 4. physical quality (thin, rough, untidy), 5.shape (round, square), 6. age (young, old, babyish), 7. colour (blue, green, pastel), 8. origin (Dutch,Japanese, northern), 9. material (metal, wood, plastic), 10. type (general-purpose, U-shaped, bedroom,four-sided), 11. purpose (folding, swinging, work, racing).Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Our guide showed us a(an) ______ _______ ________ ________(water/old/gloomy/high) tower.’ we should choose ANSWER 3: a gloomy (1. general opinion) high (3.size) old (6. age) water (9. material) tower.",adjective,1, 191 ,1200 Grammer Tests

They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘slowful’, ‘slowy’, ‘slow’ and ‘slowly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘slow’ that means ‘moving, happening, or doing something without much speed’. ‘Linda reads(how? – without much speed).’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘slow’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly.

I like the sofa _____ we saw in the mall yesterday.,2,who,that,whom,whose,"Relative pronouns who, whom, whose, which or that introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.We use ‘who’ and ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I told you about my aunt who lives next door.; I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. ‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. And we use ‘that’ for people, animals and things: The woman that is dancing over there is my boss.; I am reading the book that is on the arm-chair.; A kiwi is a bird that lives in New Zealand. ‘That’ is more informal than ‘who’, ‘whom’ or ‘which’.In the test sentence ‘I like the sofa _____ we saw in the mall yesterday.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for things, because in the relative clause we are told more about the object of the main clause – the sofa (a thing).

But usually we use ‘much’ and ‘many’ in negatives and questions.We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.).We use ‘a few’ instead of ‘some’ with plural countable nouns when we talk about a small number: a few days, a few questions, a few friends.We use the quantifier ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We also use ‘any’ to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’ to describe something which is not limited: You can choose any colours you want.; She refused to answer any questions. We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.In the test sentence ‘There is ________ good furniture in this mall.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the uncountable noun ‘furniture’. Taking into consideration that the test sentence is affirmative, we can choose ‘a lot of’ and ‘any’ from the test variants.

The present perfect tense (has eaten) usually changes to the past perfect tense (had eaten) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Mother: """"I've cooked pasta and fried chicken"""".’ we should change ‘’ve cooked’ to ‘had cooked’ or the contracted form ‘’d cooked’.

"Oh, no way, I ___________ (to see) that man before!",3,see,is seeing,have seen,has seen,"The spoken phrase ‘no way’ is used for expressing surprise, or for telling someone that you do not believe them, therefore, the speaker is surprised or he or she does not believe someone with whom he or she is talking.Then, in the test sentence ‘Oh, no way, I ___________ (to see) that man before!’ we are given the time marker – the adverb ‘before’ that means ‘at a time in the past’. Therefore, the speaker is talking about his or her experiences up to now or about something that happened in the past but is important at the time of speaking. To refer to events in the past but which connect to the present we use the present perfect simple that is formed from the present tense of the verb have and the past participle of a verb: I’ve seen the ballet performance ‘The swan lake’, but I want to see ‘Anna Karenina’.; We haven’t seen before, have we?Thus, for the test sentence ‘Oh, no way, I ___________ (to see) that man before!’ we are to choose ANSWER 3 (have seen).",present tenses,1, 203 ,1200 Grammer Tests

It can also be used for actions taking place one after another or in the middle of another action:She entered a cafe, took off her coat, sat down and took the menu.; Roby fell off the tree and her friends took her to a doctor.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in e (move – moved).In the test sentence ‘I woke up at 7 a.m., ironed my clothes and _________ (to go) out.’. we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘go’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise –arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came – come; freeze – froze – frozen; send –sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘go’ is ‘went’, therefore, we are to choose ANSWER2 (went).",past tenses,1, 204 ,1200 Grammer Tests

America ________________(to discover)  in 1492.,1,was discovered,is discovered,discovered,discovers,"The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action and the main topic of the sentence isn’t who did the action. We use the passive voice to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action.In the test sentence ‘America ________________ (to discover) in 1492.’ we show interest in America that experienced its discovery, the focus is on America’s discovery and not on the person who discoveredAmerica. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.America’s discovery is the fact of the past and in the test sentence the exact year is given when that event happened – 1492 – long ago, that means that we should use the past simple in this sentence.

"Sorry, I have no time to discuss anything. I _______________ be at work at 10 o'clock.",4,may,could,can,must,"For this test sentence we are given four modal verbs to choose: ‘may’, ‘can/could’ and ‘must’.We use ‘may’ in affirmative sentences when we are not sure about something and when we refer to weak possibility in the present and future: Our grand-children may be coming to see us at weekends.We often use ‘can’ to talk about someone’s skill or general abilities. This is something that once you have learnt you can do any time you want, like being able to read or swim or drive a car, for example: I can sing songs in English.We use could as the past tense of can to express a variety of meanings: (1) to talk about past ability:She could run very fast when she was young.; (2) to say that something was possible or impossible:Sometimes it could be very cold in winter in Russia.; (3) to express possibility in the present and the future: This cake could be tasty. (= I am not certain that it is tasty.)The modal verb ‘must’ can express ‘strong obligation and necessity’: I must talk to you about the new article.The context of the test sentence ‘Sorry, I have no time to discuss anything. I _______________ be at work at 10 o'clock.’ is connected with work obligations – something that we do because it is our duty(something that we do as part of our job or because of our position). The speaker has a job duty to be at work at 10 o’clock.

When will you come and see ______ ?’ some personal object pronoun is omitted. In the English language there are 7 personal object pronouns: me,you, him, her, it, us, and them.We use personal object pronouns after (1) verbs as the object of the verb (I love her, but she doesn't love me.; I saw her at the university yesterday.) and after (2) prepositions: He is talking to her about them.As the context is given in the test: ‘Jake, we haven't seen you for ages…’, it is evident that in the next sentence ‘When will you come and see ______ ?’ the speakers (‘we’) invite Jake to their place. Therefore,the personal object pronoun that correlates with the personal subject pronoun ‘we’ is ‘us’: ‘we’ (the personal subject pronoun) → ‘us’ (the personal object pronoun).Therefore, we choose ANSWER 4: us.",pronouns,1, 210 ,1200 Grammer Tests
I would like to buy this flat because it's ________ than that.,3,the largest,the most large,larger,more large,"In the test sentence ‘I would like to buy this flat because it's ________ than that.’ we have a marker ‘than’ that let us understand that the needed adjective is used in the comparative form.Comparative adjectives compare one person or thing with another and enable us to say whether a person or thing has more or less of a particular quality: Rebecca is taller than her older sister.In the test we are given different forms of one syllable adjective ‘large’ that ends in ‘e’: the largest,the most large, larger, more large. To form the comparative, we use the –er suffix with adjectives of one syllable: It’s hotter today than yesterday. According to the spelling rules, if one-syllable adjective ends in-e, we add -r: fine – finer, nice – nicer, etc. Therefore, we need to add –r to form the comparative form of the adjective ‘large’.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 3: larger.",adjective,1, 211 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Sandra looked at Bob ______ .,3,angryness,angryful,angrily,angry,"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘Sandra looked at Bob ______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘looked’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘angryness’, ‘angryful’, ‘angrily’ and ‘angry’ that have the same root morpheme ‘angry’ that means ‘very annoyed’. ‘Sandra looked at Bob (how? – showing anger or strong resentment).’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘angry’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘angry’. According to the spelling rules, when an adverb is formed from an adjective that ends in -y, -y turns into -i and then the suffix -ly is added: lucky – luckily, happy – happily, therefore, ‘angry’ → ‘angrily’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3: angrily.",adverbs,1, 212 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Andy has a friend _______ is a student.,3,whose,which,that,whom,"Relative pronouns who, whose, which, that or whom introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person, so,‘whose’ is for possession and possessions: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?. We use ‘whom’ (more formal) for people: I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. And we use ‘that’ for people, animals and things: The woman that is dancing over there is my boss.; I am reading the book that is on the arm-chair.; A kiwi is a bird that lives in New Zealand. ‘That’ is more informal than ‘who’, ‘whom’ or ‘which’.In the test sentence ‘Andy has a friend _______ is a student.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for people, because in the relative clause of the test sentence we are told more about the object of the main clause – a friend (a person). In the relative clause it becomes the subject ‘…_______ is a student.’,thus, we need to choose the relative pronoun that can function as the subject in the test sentence.Two test answers ‘whom’ and ‘that’ are used for describing people. ‘Whom’ introduces objects.Therefore, we choose the relative pronoun ‘that’ that can function both as the object and the subject -ANSWER 3. By using the relative pronoun ‘that’, we avoid repeating the noun ‘friend’ in the relative clause.",relative clauses,1, 213 ,1200 Grammer Tests

In the English language there a lot of collocations, they are very common in English, and learning them is important. They ‘sound right’ to native English speakers.With the noun ‘holiday’ the preposition ‘on’ collocates. There are two collocations to remember: ‘be on holiday’ and ‘go on holiday’: This summer we will travel to Spain on holiday.; They met while on holiday in Sicily.; I am away on holiday for the next three weeks.; Several years ago I went on holiday with my family to France.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: on.",prepositions,1, 215 ,1200 Grammer Tests

"I would like _________ cheese, please.",2,any,some,a few,many,"In the test sentence ‘I would like _________ cheese, please.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the uncountable noun ‘cheese’.‘A few’ (instead of ‘some’ when we talk about a small number) and ‘many’ (‘a large number of’) are used with plural countable nouns: a few days, a few questions, a few friends; I don’t have many dresses.The quantifiers ‘any’ and ‘some’ as determiners can be used before both countable and uncountable nouns. When using ‘some’ or ‘any’, the exact number is not stated.We use ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We also use ‘any’ to mean ‘it does not matter which or what’ to describe something which is not limited: You can choose any colours you want.; She refused to answer any questions. We use this meaning of ‘any’ with all types of nouns and usually in affirmative sentences.We use ‘some’ to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.; I would like some coffee.) and in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?). In polite requests ‘I’d like some + noun’ we use the quantifier ‘some’ if we mean indefinite quantities: I’d like some coffee, please. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (‘some’): ‘I would like some cheese, please.’ [I don't know exactly how much, but I mean a certain amount of cheese,probably some slices or a cheese plate. I don't want all the cheese in the world.].","some,any, a lot of , many , much ,etc..",1, 218 ,1200 Grammer Tests
If you ________ (to be) more attentive you _________ (to pass) the exam.,1,were/would pass,would be/passed,would be/would pass,were/passed,"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, event sor situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.The test sentence ‘If you ________ (to be) more attentive you _________ (to pass) the exam.’ describes an unlikely situation. It is meant that ‘You haven’t been attentive all this time, that is why I doubt that you will pass your exam.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that you could become more attentive, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.",conditionals,1, 219 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use a reporting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office. But we often omit ‘that’,especially in informal situations.If the reporting verb is in the past tense (She said…), usually we change the tenses in the reported speech: She said (that) she worked in an office. In all the test answers the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Kate said…’. In reported speech the future (‘I will dance…’) usually becomes the future-in- the-past(‘she/he would dance…’). But it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she plans to do it tomorrow – we can use the future simple in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Kate says/said that she will do it tomorrow.’ is not given.Moreover, we also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement (the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc.Thus, we are to choose only ANSWER 3, because in reported speech ‘tomorrow’ changes into ‘the next day’ or ‘the following day’.",reported speech,1, 220 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Choose the sentence with the right word order,1,Harry lived in a big modern house.,Harry lived in a modern big house.,In a modern big house lived Harry.,Harry in a big modern house lived.,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given two nouns: the proper noun ‘Harry’ and the common noun ‘house’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘lived’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘a house’ cannot ‘live’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Harry’ (who?) is the subject and ‘house’ is the part of the adverbial modifier of place in the test sentence (lived where? → in a house). Thus,we found the subject, the predicate and the adverbial modifier of place of the test sentence: ‘Harry lived ina…house.’. We are given two ANSWERS with this order: ANSWER 1 and ANSWER 2.Then, we need to choose the right adjective order before the common noun ‘house’: ‘a big modern house’ or ‘a modern big house’. When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally ina particular order. The most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, lovely,nice, etc.); 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun (delicious, comfortable, clever, friendly); 3. size (big, tall); 4. physical quality (thin, untidy); 5. shape (round); 6. age (young, old); 7. colour (green, pastel); 8. origin (Dutch,northern); 9. material (metal, wood); 10. type (general-purpose, U-shaped, four-sided); 11.purpose (folding, work, racing).Thus, for the test sentence we need to choose ANSWER 1: Harry lived in a big (3. size) modern (6.age) house.",word order,1, 221 ,1200 Grammer Tests

We use ‘a’ when the next word starts with a consonant (a boy, a dog), or before words starting in u and eu when they sound like you (a university, a unit, a European style, a euro). We use ‘an’ when the next word starts with a vowel (a, e, i, o, u) or with a mute h (an actor, an invitation, an eagle, an old school, an umbrella, an hour). We do not use an indefinite article with plural nouns (bears) and uncountable nouns (advice): I saw some bears in the Zoo.; She gave me good advice.We use the definite article ‘the’ before a noun to refer to something which has already been mentioned, to show that what is referred to is already known to the speaker, listener, writer and/or reader: We went to the restaurant yesterday.; The sun rose at 5.34 in the morning.; I’ve read a book on the life of Angelina Jolie.In the test sentence ‘Vicky told us _ interesting story.’ we should choose the article that stands before the countable noun ‘story’ (thus, we do not need ANSWER 4 ‘-’) before which the adjective ‘interesting’ is used that starts with the vowel ‘i’ (thus, it is not ANSWER 1 ‘a’).

Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came– come; freeze – froze – frozen; send – sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘meet’ is ‘met’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (met).",past tenses,1, 224 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Australia ________________ (to discover) by Dutch explorers in 1606.,3,is discovered,discovered,was discovered,discovers,"The passive voice is used when we want to focus attention on the person or thing affected by the action. The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We can leave out the ‘doer’ or agent, or we can place the ‘doer’ in a prepositional phrase (by + ‘doer’). We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.As the exact year of Australia’s discovery is stated in the test sentence ‘Australia ________________(to discover) by Dutch explorers in 1606.’, we understand that we should use the Past Simple passive in this sentence. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 ‘was discovered’. ‘Discovered’ is the past participle of the regular verb ‘discover’.In the test sentence the main focus is on the name of the country - Australia (the smallest continent in the world and the 6th largest country in the world, after Russia, Canada, China, USA, and Brazil) that is the subject of the test sentence.The ‘doer’ is placed in the prepositional phrase ‘by Dutch explorers’. We use this structure ‘passive +by + doer’ when the agent/doer is important.

He's too _________ .,2,unresponsible,irresponsible,inresponsible,ilresponsible,"In the test variants we are given the adjective ‘responsible’ with four prefixes un-, ir-, in-, il-.Prefixes such as un-, in-, im-, il- and ir- change the meaning of adjectives. Adding these prefixes makes the meaning negative: fair – unfair, active – inactive, regular – irregular, balance – imbalance,legal – illegal, etc.As for the prefix re-, it means ‘not, or no’ and it is used with some adjectives and nouns that begin with ‘r’ to give the opposite meaning: irregularity, irreplaceable, irreducible, irrational, etc.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (irresponsible).",adjective,1, 231 ,1200 Grammer Tests
She ran _________ .,4,quickful,quicky,quick,quickly,"We use adverbs to add more information about a verb, an adjective, another adverb, a clause or a whole sentence. In the test sentence ‘She ran ______ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘ran’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘quickful’, ‘quicky’, ‘quick’ and ‘quickly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘quick’ that means ‘fast’. ‘She ran (how? – with great speed), therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘quick’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the main verb.Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘quick’: ‘quick’ → ‘quickly’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: quickly.",adverbs,1, 232 ,1200 Grammer Tests
The person ______ I gave my keys is my aunt.,3,whose,which,whom,what,"Relative pronouns whose, which, who, that or whom introduce a relative clause. Relative clauses give us more information about someone or something (the subject or object of a main clause), help us combine clauses without repeating information and give focus to something or someone: She bought a dress, which is rather pretty. By combining sentences with a relative clause, we make our speech more fluent.‘Whose’ is used to say that something or someone is connected with or belongs to a person,so, ‘whose’ is for possession and possessions: She has a sister whose name I can’t remember. We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.; Do you see that cat which is lying on the bench?. ‘What’ is a question-word.We use ‘whom’ for people (more formal than ‘who’): I was invited to Isabel whom I had met at the conference. In this sentence ‘whom’ is the direct object of the verb met and also introduces the clause ‘…whom I had met at the conference’. This clause modifies the proper noun Isabel.In the test sentence ‘The person ______ I gave my keys is my aunt.’ we need to choose a relative pronoun that is used for people, because in the relative clause of the test sentence we are told more about the subject of the main clause – the person. In the relative clause it turns into the object ‘... _____ I gave my keys is my aunt.’.The test answer ‘whom’ introduces objects and it is used for describing people. Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 3.",relative clauses,1, 233 ,1200 Grammer Tests

"_____ last, we found the street.",4,in,on,for,at,"In the test sentence ‘_____ last, we found the street.’ the preposition is omitted that collocates with the adverb ‘last’.The phrase ‘at last’ or ‘at long last’ is a ‘grammatical’ collocation – a word or phrase that is often used with another word or phrase, in a way that sounds correct to people who have spoken the language all their lives, but might not be expected from the meaning. It used for saying that something happens after you have been hoping, waiting, or working for it a long time = finally. Like ‘finally’, ‘at last’ occurs in the normal mid position for adverbs as well as in front and end position: At last, spring has come to this part ofIreland.

In accordance with dictionaries, we can use two prepositions after the adjective ‘afraid’:(1) of (She’s always been afraid of spiders.; I’m afraid of being lost.) and (2) for (He was afraid for his children. = He believed that they might be hurt, that they were in danger.; Many of us are afraid for our jobs.).

"Alex, I hope you'll tell me ___________ good.",1,something,anything,some,someone,"Something, anything, some, someone etc. are indefinite pronouns. We use them to talk about a person, thing or place, when we don’t know who or what they are, or it is not important. We use such pronouns ending in -body or -one for people, and pronouns ending in -thing for things.In the test sentence ‘Alex, I hope you'll tell me ___________ good.’ the speaker refers to some good information – a thing, not a person: you’ll tell me what?. Therefore, we cannot use ‘someone’ here.We can use ‘some’ here neither as a determiner, because there is no noun after it, nor as a pronoun because after it the adjective ‘good’ is given without any noun. It could be possible to use ‘some’ here, if there was the noun ‘news’ after the adjective ‘good’: I hope you’ll tell me some good news.The indefinite pronoun anything can be used in affirmative sentences with a meaning that is close to every-: whichever person, whichever place, whichever thing, etc. (I can do anything for you.). But in this sentence the speaker does not mean ‘any/whichever information’, not any news, but he or she means good news. ‘Anything’ can be used in the question: Could you tell me anything good?Thus, the speaker refers to a thing about which he or she knows nothing, and the sentence is affirmative that is why we choose ANSWER 1 ‘something’ – ‘an object, situation, quality that is not exactly known or stated’.","some,any, a lot of , many , much ,etc..",1, 238 ,1200 Grammer Tests
He ________ (to fall) ill if he _________ (to eat) so much ice-cream.,2,falls/will eat,will fall/eats,will fall/will eat,falls/eats,"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a ‘main clause’ – that are closely related. There are different types of conditions. Some are possible or likely, others are unlikely or even impossible.For the test sentence ‘He ________ (to fall) ill if he _________ (to eat) so much ice-cream.’ we are given four variants of ANSWERS, but all include ‘will’ (will fall, will eat) and ‘eat’ or ‘fall’ (eats, falls) indifferent combinations, therefore, this sentence expresses an imagined future situation (It is possible or likely that he will fall ill because of so much ice-cream.). When we talk about real and possible situations, we use the first conditional. In first conditional sentences, the structure is usually if + present simple (an imagined future situation) and will (or shall, should, would, can, could, may, might) + infinitive (a future result): I fit’s a nice day tomorrow, we’ll go to the beach.

In other words, there is no inversion of the subject and auxiliary in the reported clause (the word order is the same as in the statement).Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause and the reported clause. When we report Wh- questions we repeat the original question word - in the test sentence it is ‘When…’, but we don’t use a question mark. We make the same changes in tense, pronouns and time and place words as for reported statements. If the reporting clause is in the simple past, we usually need to change the tenses in the reported clause: Monica asked: “When does George arrive in London?” → (1. the reporting clause) Monica asked: (2. the reported clause) when George arrived in London. Due to the rules, the present simple tense usually turns into the past simple tense in reported speech.In all the test variants the reporting clause is in the past: ‘Paul asked…’, therefore, we need to change the present simple into the past simple tense in the reported clause: ‘does… arrive’ (Wh-question) →‘arrived’ (statement word order). Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 1.We should add that it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – the train is still to arrive – we can use the present simple (train time-table) in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Monica asks/asked when the train arrives.’ is not given.""",reported speech,1, 240 ,1200 Grammer Tests
Choose the sentence with the right word order,4,My purse my brother found outside the house.,Outside the house found my brother my purse.,My brother outside the house found my purse.,My brother found my purse outside the house,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given three common nouns: ‘purse’, ‘house’ and ‘brother’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘found’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘a house’ or ‘a purse’ cannot ‘find’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘brother’ (who?) is the subject, ‘purse’ is the object and ‘house’ is the part of the adverbial modifier of place in the test sentence (found where? → outside the house). Thus, we found the subject, the predicate, the object and the adverbial modifier of place of the test sentence: ‘My brother found my purse outside the house.’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4.",word order,1, 241 ,1200 Grammer Tests

We do not normally use the definite article with names: America, Austria, Barbados, Italy,France, Russia, Spain, etc. But we do use ‘the’ with countries that include the words ‘republic’, ‘kingdom’,or ‘states’ in their names: He is visiting the United Kingdom of Great Britain.; Connor is from the Republic of Ireland.; The Russian Federation is the largest country in the world by land area. So, we should use ‘the’ if the country’s name includes a common noun.The name of the country that is given in the test sentence (United States of America) includes the common noun ‘states’, therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (the).",articles,1, 242 ,1200 Grammer Tests
I'm fond of history. I often _________ (to go) to museums.,1,go,goes,am going,has gone,"In the test sentence ‘I'm fond of history. I often _________ (to go) to museums.’ The speaker informs us about regular or habitual (usual or repeated) events. Therefore, we need to use the present simple tense.To form the present simple tense we use the base form of the verb, and add -s for the third person singular:I dance. She dances.; I study English. He studies English.Moreover, the speaker uses the adverb of frequency ‘often’. The present simple tense is often used with adverbs of frequency: always, frequently, often, seldom, regularly, sometimes, never, usually, etc.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (go).",present tenses,1, 243 ,1200 Grammer Tests
We __________ (to go) to Australia last year.,1,went,had gone,were going,were gone,"In the test sentence ‘We __________ (to go) to Australia last year.’ we are given the phrase ‘last year’ that is typical for the past simple tense.We use the past tense to talk about something that happened once in the past - a completed action ina time before now. Duration is not important: Sally watched TV last night.; Did you play tennis at weekends?. It can also be used for actions taking place one after another or in the middle of another action: She entered a cafe, took off her coat, sat down and took the menu.For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in -e (move – moved).In the test sentence we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘go’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; bleed – bled – bled; come – came –come; freeze – froze – frozen; send – sent – sent, etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘go’ is ‘went’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (went).",past tenses,1, 244 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Everybody _________________ (to inform) about the accident tomorrow.,2,inform,will be informed,is informed,was informed,"We use the passive when we want to change the focus of a clause – (1) to focus on the action, or (2)to show interest in the person or object that experiences this action, or (3) if the doer of the verb is not important or not known or (4) if we do not want to say who the doer is. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence. In the test sentence ‘Everybody ______ (to inform) about the accident tomorrow.’ the doer is not given, thus, the speaker wants to focus on the action itself or on the people that experience this action, and evidently, the doer is not important.We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.In the test sentence we are given the adverb of time ‘tomorrow’. And the adverbs of time like tomorrow, today, later today, in five minutes, in two hours, on Monday, on Saturday afternoon, next week/month indicate the future aspect. Therefore, we should use the Future tense in this sentence. For forming the future simple passive we use the structure ‘the object of the sentence that is in the Active voice+ will + be + the past participle’: The window will be opened.; I will be helped by her.; The lesson will be learnt.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 – ‘will be informed’.",passive voice,1, 246 ,1200 Grammer Tests

In the English language there are 7 possessive determiners: my, your, his, her, its, our and their.In the test sentence ‘They have done _______ work properly.’ some possessive determiner is omitted that is used before the noun ‘work’: ‘They have done whose work?’.As the context is given in the test: ‘They have done _______ work…’, it is evident that further the speaker informs somebody about these people’s work.

Therefore, we choose the relative pronoun ‘whose’, because it introduces the relative clause (…,______ car it is,…) indicating possession by the man: that car that is mentioned in the relative clause belongs to the man.Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (whose).",relative clauses,1, 253 ,1200 Grammer Tests

If we speak about someone’s spouse it’s not possible to use ‘be married with anyone’, we can use only one preposition in this case – ‘be married to someone’. The preposition ‘with’ is used after the adjective ‘married’ only if we are speaking about a child or children of this or that married couple: They are married with twins.; I’d like to be married with kids.Therefore, as the context is given, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (to).",adjective pluse preposition,1, 256 ,1200 Grammer Tests

We use ‘some’ as a determiner before both countable and uncountable nouns to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) But we can use ‘some’ in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).We use ‘a few’ instead of ‘some’ with plural countable nouns when we talk about a small number: a few days, a few questions, a few friends. We use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns (I don’t have many dresses.). We use ‘much’ that means ‘a large amount or to a large degree’ with singular uncountable nouns (I don’t earn much money.). We usually use ‘much’ with questions (?) and negatives(−). In affirmative clauses we sometimes use ‘much’ in more formal styles: There is much concern about drug addiction in the world.The test sentence ‘Kate doesn't have ________ knowledge at Maths.’ is negative, therefore, we cannot choose ‘some’ here.

If you ___________ (to speak) louder I _________ (to hear) her address well.,1,spoke/would hear,would speak/heard,would speak/would hear,spoke/heard,"Conditionals are sentences with two clauses – an ‘if clause’ and a main clause. The two parts can be in any order. When the ‘would part’ is second, you need a comma.The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility.As the test answers consist only of ‘spoke/heard’ and ‘would speak/would hear’ variants, the test sentence ‘If you ___________ (to speak) louder I _________ (to hear) her address well.’ describes an unlikely situation. It means that ‘You haven’t spoken louder, that is why I haven’t heard her address well.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that you could speak louder, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation.As for the test ANSWER, we are to choose ANSWER 1 (spoke/would hear).",conditionals,1, 259 ,1200 Grammer Tests

The regular action or event can be a habit, a hobby, a daily event, a scheduled event or something that often happens. But remember that the present continuous can be used with words such as ‘always’ or ‘constantly’ to express the idea that something irritating or shocking often happens. Notice that the meaning is like the present simple, but with a negative emotion: She is always coming late.The present simple tense is the base form of the verb: I work in New York. But the third person(she/he/it) adds an -s: She works in New York.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (drinks).",present tenses,1, 263 ,1200 Grammer Tests
My cat _____________ (to play) with a toy when I called it.,1,was playing,played,play,has played,"The most common use of the past continuous tense is to talk about something that was happening around a particular time in the past: ‘In 2015 she was working in New York.’ The past continuous is formed from the past tense of be (was/were) with the -ing form of the verb.The past continuous and the past simple are often used together. When this happens, the past continuous describes a longer, ‘surrounding’ action or situation and the past simple describes the action or events: It was raining hard when we left the office. Often, the ‘action’described by the past simple tense interrupts the ‘situation’ described by the past continuous tense – when anew action happens in the middle of another action: Helen was talking to Max, when she heard Alex’s voice.The past continuous describes ‘situations’ that go on for some time – ‘raining’ and ‘talking’ but the past simple describes ‘actions’ that happen quickly – ‘left’ and ‘heard’.In the test sentence ‘My cat _____________ (to play) with a toy when I called it.’ we are given the context ‘…when I called it.’ and we understand that my call interrupted some ‘surrounding’ situation: some action was happening before my call - a longer action in the past was interrupted. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 1 – ‘was playing’.",past tenses,1, 264 ,1200 Grammer Tests

My wallet _____________ (to steal) yesterday.,4,was stole,stole,is stolen,was stolen,"The passive voice is used when the focus is on the action and the main topic of the sentence isn’t who did the action. We use the passive voice to show interest in the person or object that experiences an action. In the test sentence ‘My wallet _____________ (to steal) yesterday.’ the main focus is on the object ‘my wallet’ (the subject of the test sentence) that experiences the action (to steal). The ‘doer’ is not stated, thus, it is not important who did the action.The passive is usually formed by the verb to be + past participle. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents.As the exact time-signal is stated in the test sentence ‘My wallet _____________ (to steal)yesterday.’, we understand that we should use the Past Simple passive in this sentence. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4 ‘was stolen’. ‘Stolen’ is the past participle of the irregular verb ‘steal’.",passive voice,1, 266 ,1200 Grammer Tests

They refer back to the subject forms of personal pronouns: Steven was in such a hurry this morning that he cut himself shaving.For the test sentence ‘Tom, be careful with the knife! You can cut _____ .’ we need to choose the reflexive pronoun that refers to the subject form of the personal pronoun ‘you’: you → yourself (singular) or yourselves (plural). As we are given the context ‘Tom, be careful with the knife! You…’, we understand that the speaker cautions one person – Tom, therefore, we need the singular form of the reflexive pronoun ‘yourself’.

Andy is always _________ .,3,ilattentive,unattentive,inattentive,imattentive,"In the test variants we are given the adjective ‘attentive’ with four prefixes il-, un-, in-, im- that change the meaning of adjectives. Adding these prefixes makes the meaning negative: fair –unfair, active – inactive, regular – irregular, balance – imbalance, legal – illegal, etc.Words that take il– as a negative prefix always begin with the letter l: legal – illegal, literate –illiterate and words that take im– as a negative prefix always begin with the letter m or p: mobile –immobile, perfect - imperfect, etc. Words that take un– as a negative prefix may begin with a vowel or consonant: able – unable, usual - unusual. Words that take in– as a negative prefix can begin with a vowel(except i or u) or a consonant: accurate – inaccurate, eligible – ineligible, organic – inorganic, decent –indecent, sane – insane. So, in accordance with the rules we can add either un- or in- to the test adjective ‘attentive’, because it starts with the vowel ‘a’.And how to choose: un- or in-? To understand which prefix to use it is necessary to know the language the word comes from – to determine the origin of the root morpheme: words of the Germanic origin take the prefix un-, while words that came into English from Latin take the prefix in-. The adjective ‘attentive’ comes from the Old French word ‘attentif’ that in its turn comes from the Latin word ‘attenditus’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 (inattentive).",adjective,1, 271 ,1200 Grammer Tests

In the test sentence ‘Rachel managed to do the task ________ .’ we add more information about the verb ‘do’.Adverbs have many different meanings and functions. They are especially important for indicating the time (when), manner (the way something happens or is done, how something happens), place (where), degree (how) and frequency (how often) of something.In the test we are given four variants: ‘correctful’, ‘correcty’, ‘correct’ and ‘correctly’ that have the same root morpheme ‘correct’ that means ‘right, having no mistakes’. ‘Rachel managed to do the task how? – without any mistakes.’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘correct’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. In the test sentence it is after the infinitive + the object (to do the task how?).Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave -bravely, sudden – suddenly. Thus, we need to add –ly to the adjective ‘correct’: ‘correct’ → ‘correctly’.Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 4: correctly.

But for the test sentence we need to choose a relative pronoun that is the subject of the relative clause (I saw Jack, _____ is a…). In this case, we are to choose only the relative pronoun ‘who’ (ANSWER 2), because the relative pronoun ‘whom’ is used instead of ‘who’ as the object of a verb or preposition: Have you seen those people whom we met on holiday? Here, ‘we’ is the subject.We use ‘which’ for things and animals: We don’t go to restaurants which serve meat.

"""Alice: """"John is always polite"""".""",4,Alice said that John was being always polite,Alice said that John would be always polite,Alice said that John had always been polite,Alice said that John was always polite.,"""When we report someone’s words we can do it in two ways: (1) we can use direct speech with quotation marks (“I work in an office.”), or (2) we can use reported speech (She said she worked in an office.) Speech reports consist of two parts: the reporting clause (She said that …) in which we usually use are porting verb (e.g. say, tell, ask, etc.) and the reported clause (…she worked in an office.).Some verbs (accept, agree, complain, feel, say, etc.) connected with reporting can be followed bya that-clause acting as the direct object: She said that she worked in an office.Usually we change the tense of what was actually said in direct speech. The present simple tense (‘I dance’) usually changes to the past simple (she/he danced) in reported speech. Therefore, in the test sentence ‘Alice: """"John is always polite"""".’ we should change ‘is’ into ‘was’. But it is not always necessary to change the tense. If something is still true now – she still works in an office – we can use the present simple in the reported sentence.

Choose the sentence with the right word order,3,Julia bought eleven yellow amazing tulips.,Julia eleven amazing yellow tulips bought.,Julia bought eleven amazing yellow tulips.,Julia eleven yellow amazing tulips bought.,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given two nouns: the proper noun ‘Julia’ and the common noun ‘tulips’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one action verb ‘bought’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb.As ‘tulips’ cannot ‘buy’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Julia’ (who?) is the subject and ‘tulips’ is the object in the test sentence (Julia bought what? → …tulips). Thus, we found the subject,the predicate and the object of the test sentence: ‘Julia bought…tulips.’. We are given two ANSWERS with this order: ANSWER 1 and ANSWER 3.Then, we need to choose the right adjective order before the common noun ‘tulips’: ‘yellow amazing tulips’ or ‘amazing yellow tulips’. When more than one adjective comes before a noun, the adjectives are normally in a particular order. The most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, lovely, nice, etc.); 2. specific opinion (We only use such adjectives that give a specific opinion to describe particular kinds of noun (delicious, friendly); 3. size (big, tall); 4. physical quality (thin,untidy); 5. shape (round); 6. age (young, old); 7. colour (green, pastel); 8. origin (Dutch, northern); 9.material (metal, wood); 10. type (general-purpose, four-sided); 11. purpose (folding, work).Thus, for the test sentence we need to choose ANSWER 3: Julia bought eleven amazing (1. General opinion) yellow (7. colour) tulips.",word order,1, 281 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Therefore, the speaker is talking about something that happened in the past but is important at the time of speaking. To refer to events in the past but which connect to the present we use the present perfect simple that is formed from the present tense of the verb have and the past participle of a verb: I’ve seen the ballet performance ‘The swan lake’, but I want to see ‘Anna Karenina’.; We haven’t seen before, have we?Thus, for the test sentence ‘I can't find Mark.

We use the past tense to talk about something that happened once in the past - a completed action in a time before now. Duration is not important: Sally watched TV last night.; Did you play tennis at weekends?. For regular verbs, we add -ed to the base form of the verb (work – worked) or -d if the verb already ends in -e (move – moved). In the test sentence we need to form the past form of the irregular verb ‘give’. Many verbs are irregular and we have to learn them: arise – arose – arisen; bet – bet – bet; freeze – froze – frozen; etc. The past form of the irregular verb ‘give’ is ‘gave’. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 2 (gave).",past tenses,1, 284 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Your sofa _____________ (to deliver) tomorrow.,3,is delivered,was delivered,will be delivered,delivers,"We use the passive when we want to change the focus of a clause – (1) to focus on the action, or (2) to show interest in the person or object that experiences this action, or (3) if the doer of the verb is not important or not known or (4) if we do not want to say who the doer is. In English we tend to put the most important thing at the start of the sentence. In the test sentence ‘Your sofa _____________ (to deliver) tomorrow.’ the doer is not given, thus, the speaker wants to focus on the action itself or on the thing that experiences this action, and evidently, the doer is not important. We make the passive using ‘be’ (in a suitable tense) + the past participle: be + done. The passive can be used with all tenses - the form of ‘be’ changes. We use passive forms of tenses in the same way as we use their active equivalents. In the test sentence we are given the adverb of time ‘tomorrow’. And the adverbs of time like tomorrow, later today, in five minutes, in two hours, on Monday, on Saturday afternoon, next week/month indicate the future aspect. Therefore, we should use the Future form in this sentence. For forming the future simple passive we use the structure ‘the object of the sentence that is in the Active voice + will + be + the past participle’: The window will be opened.; The lesson will be learnt. Therefore, we are to choose ANSWER 3 – ‘will be delivered’.",passive voice,1, 286 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Adjectives which describe opinions or attitudes (e.g. lovely, amazing) usually come first, before more neutral, factual ones (e.g. red, green): A girl was wearing a lovely green dress. Not: … green lovely dress. It is very unusual to have more than three adjectives in front of a noun. But if it is so, the most usual sequence of adjectives is the following: 1. general opinion (good, bad, lovely, nice, etc.), 2. specific opinion ((a) food: tasty; delicious; (b) furniture, buildings: comfortable; uncomfortable; (c) people, animals: clever; friendly.), 3. size/length/height (big, tall), 4. physical quality (thin, untidy), 5.shape (round, square), 6. age (young, babyish), 7. colour (green, pastel), 8. origin (Dutch, northern), 9.material (metal, wood), 10. type (general-purpose, four-sided), 11. purpose (folding, work, racing).In the test variants we have two adjectives of the same characteristics – size/height: ‘big’ and ‘three-storey’. If two adjectives with similar meanings are used, the shorter one often comes first, e.g.: a soft comfortable pillow. In the test the adjective ‘big’ is the shorter one, thus, we place it before the adjective ‘three-storey’: ‘…big three-storey…’.Therefore, in this sentence we should choose ANSWER 3: a nice (1. general opinion) big (3. size) three-storey (3. height) detached (10. type) house.",adjective,1, 291 ,1200 Grammer Tests

I don't read _______ newspapers at all.,1,any,a lot of,many,some,"We use the quantifiers ‘any’, ‘a lot of’, ‘many’ and ‘some’ to talk about quantities, amounts and degree. We can use them with a noun (as a determiner) or without a noun (as a pronoun). We use the quantifier ‘any’ in questions and negatives to mean ‘some’ with countable and uncountable nouns: Did you buy any butter?; We haven’t got any eggs. We use ‘a lot of’ to talk about a large amount in informal styles with plural countable nouns and with singular uncountable nouns for all types of sentences (affirmatives, negatives, and questions): I’ve got a lot of work to do.; I haven’t seen a lot of films this year.; Have you seen a lot of attractions in London today?But usually we use ‘many’ that means ‘a large number of’ with plural nouns in negatives (I don’t have many dresses.) and questions (Do you get many visitors?).We use ‘some’ to refer to indefinite quantities: some snow, some people. ‘Some’ is used in positive sentences (I drink some coffee every morning.) and in questions when we are offering something (Would you like some mango ice-cream?) or when we are making a request (Can I buy some ice-cream?).In the test sentence ‘I don’t read _______ newspapers at all.’ we need to choose a quantifier for the plural noun ‘newspapers’. As the test sentence is negative (don’t read…), we could choose ‘many’ and ‘any’ from the test variants. But the phrase ‘at all’ is used to make negatives and questions stronger meaning ‘in any way or of any type’, especially after words such as ‘any’, ‘anything’, ‘anyone’, or ‘nothing’. Therefore, we are to choose only ANSWER 1 (any).","some,any, a lot of , many , much ,etc..",1, 298 ,1200 Grammer Tests
If I __________ (to meet) Johnny Depp I _________ (to ask) for the autograph.,4,would meet/would ask,would meet/asked,met/asked,met/would ask,"The second conditional is used to talk about unreal, unlikely, impossible or imaginary things, events or situations. The structure is usually if + past simple (the hypothetical or unlikely part) and would/could/might + infinitive (the possible result of the imaginary situation): If I had lots of money, I would travel all around the world.; If I won the lottery, I would buy a car. We are thinking about a particular condition in the future, and the result of this condition. But there is not a real possibility that this condition will happen. Therefore, we use the Second conditional structure for unreal possibility. As the test answers consist only of ‘met/asked’ and ‘would meet/would ask’ variants, the test sentence ‘If I __________ (to meet) Johnny Depp I _________ (to ask) for the autograph.’ describes an unlikely situation. It means that ‘I haven’t met Johnny Depp yet, that is why I haven’t asked for his address.’. The speaker is still thinking about the future possibility, but it is imaginary – I imagine that I could meet Johnny Depp and ask for his autograph, but it is unlikely. In this case the question between the first and the second conditional is often a question of the speaker’s attitude to the situation. As for the test ANSWER, we are to choose ANSWER 4 (met/would ask).",conditionals,1, 299 ,1200 Grammer Tests

If something is still true now – he is still taking shower – we can use the present continuous in the reported sentence. But in the test the variant ‘Simon said that he is taking shower now.’ is not given. We also need to change time expressions in reported speech if the context of the reported statement (the period of time) is different from that of the direct speech: ‘now’ → ‘then’, ‘last week’ → ‘the week before’ etc. Thus, we are to choose ANSWER 2.""",reported speech,1, 300 ,1200 Grammer Tests

Choose the sentence with the right word order,2,Patrick White received in 1973 the Nobel Prize.,Patrick White received the Nobel Prize in 1973.,In 1973 the Nobel Prize Patrick White received.,Received Patrick White the Nobel Prize in 1973.,"English has a rigid word order that cannot be changed without changing the meaning of the sentence.In the test we are given a declarative sentence (statement). The standard word order in declarative sentences is SUBJECT + PREDICATE (Verb) + object + adverbial modifier. We are to find the subject, the predicate, the object and/or the adverbial modifier in the test sentence.The subject is placed at the beginning of the sentence and is usually expressed by a noun or a pronoun. In the test we are given the proper noun ‘Patrick White’ and the well-known word combination ‘the Nobel Prize’ that includes the proper name ‘Nobel’. When looking for the subject in a sentence, we need to look for the verb first. A verb is a word that helps a subject perform an action (ran, drank, fights, swims). In the test sentence there is only one verb ‘received’ that is in the past simple tense, thus, it is the predicate. The predicate stands after the subject and is usually represented by a main verb or by the combination of an auxiliary or modal verb with a main verb. As ‘the Nobel Prize’ cannot ‘receive’, we understand that in the test sentence ‘Patrick White’ (who?) is the subject and ‘the Nobel Prize’ is the object in the test sentence (Patrick White received what? → the Nobel Prize). Thus, we found the subject, the predicate and the object of the test sentence: ‘Patrick White received the Noble Prize…’. Then, we have the adverbial modifier of time ‘in1973’ that can be put at the beginning of the sentence or at the end. ANSWER 2 reflects the proper structure ‘SUBJECT + PREDICATE + object + adverbial modifier’.Therefore, we choose ANSWER 2.",word order,1, 321 ,1200 Grammer Tests

If someone comes tell ______ to wait for a while.,4,he,her,him,them,"Cambridge and Oxford grammarians say that we often use the plural pronouns ‘they’, ‘them’, ‘their’ etc., to refer back to (singular) someone or somebody when we do not know if the person is male or female, despite the fact that they are referring back to a singular noun: Never judge someone by the way they look.; A researcher has to be completely objective in their findings.; Someone has forgotten their handbag. Or we can say ‘Never judge someone by the way he or she looks.’; A researcher has to be completely objective in his or her findings.; Someone has forgotten his or her handbag. Some people object to the use of plural pronouns in this type of situation on the grounds that it’s ungrammatical. In fact, the use of plural pronouns to refer back to a singular subject isn’t new - it dates back to the 16 th century and now it’s common in current English and it is now widely accepted. The American Heritage College Dictionary’ recommends to use ‘he or she’ when you are writing a formal document.In the test sentence ‘If someone comes tell ______ to wait for a while.’ that is the example of the oral speech we need to choose the pronoun that is the object of the sentence: ‘…tell (whom?) ______ to wait…’.

In the test we are given four variants: ‘smarty’, ‘smart’, ‘smartly’ and ‘smartful’ that have the same root morpheme ‘smart’ that has several meanings: (1) ‘stylish’; (2) ‘intelligent’; (3) ‘quick’; (4) ‘without respect’. As the test sentence is connected with clothes, we understand that we need to choose the first meaning of the adjective ‘smart’ for the test sentence: ‘Peter always dresses how? – in a stylish way’, therefore, we are to change the adjective ‘smart’ into the adverb of manner that is usually placed either after the main verb or after the object. Adverbs of manner are often formed from adjectives by adding -ly: bad – badly, brave bravely, sudden – suddenly.
